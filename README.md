# Angfire2Chat

### Info

This is the first app I've built using Angular 2 and Firebase (angularfire2), incorperating real-time chat and user auth.

### Todos

1) There's a bug at login that doesn't redirect to the chat page. Currently the user needs to refresh after logging in.
2) Make it look a whole lot nicer!!!

### Hosting

You can find this app in it's current state [here](https://angfire2-chat.firebaseapp.com), hosted by Firebase.
